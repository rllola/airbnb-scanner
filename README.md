## Dev

### With Virtualenv (Recommended)

Call it `venv` really important!

```
$ virtualenv venv -p $(which python3.7) --always-copy
$ source venv\bin\activate
```


```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Notes

### Scapy root privileges needed

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36215201/python-scapy-sniff-without-root

```
$ setcap cap_net_raw=eip venv/bin/python
```

But also we need `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` to match the user folder so no root to see the tray icon.

### Packaging with pyqtdeploy

Error :
```
_ctypes.c:107:10: fatal error: ffi.h: No such file or directory
```
Answer :
```
sudo apt install libffi-dev
```

----

### Release

It takes too long to build in CI. Instead builds are being done locally on my computer (maybe for the best).
```
make build
```

Using semver standard.

----

### Linux libcrypto

Requires `libssl1.1` for the latest version.
